This project was created using "create-react-app" for simple start up.

I have added the components and style folders in ./src. I have also added sudokuBoard.js and sudokuBoardStyle.css.
The rest was genereted with "create-react-app".

1. You need to have Node.js installed to run the program.
2. Run "npm install" and then "npm start" in the ./sudoku directory
3. The program will not function as intended at the moment. Since no backtracking is
   present, the program will evetually get stuck, trying to find a value to insert.
   It can happen on any row depending on the "luck" is has finding a value to insert.
